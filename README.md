# Tree Sculpture

This JavaScript code was created for an LED tree sculpture that reflects the changing seasons. The tree begins with a boot-up cycle, then transitions to summer colors, followed by fall, winter, and finally spring. It will repeat this summer-to-spring cycle continuously until the LEDs are powered off. This code is designed to be flashed onto the PixelBlaze WiFi LED controller, controlling 300 individually addressable LEDs. The code can be modified to work with LED strips containing more than 300 LEDs if needed.

## Instructions to Run Code

1. **Set Up PixelBlaze WiFi LED Controller**  
   Follow the instructions [here](https://electromage.com/docs/quickstart-v3-standard) to set up the PixelBlaze controller.

2. **Load the Code onto PixelBlaze**  
   - Once connected to the controller, navigate to the PixelBlaze IDE.
   - Create a new pattern within the IDE.
   - Paste the code from `pattern.js` into the code editor.
   - Save the code, and the pattern should automatically start.

3. **Restarting the Pattern**  
   - To restart the pattern, make a small, non-logical change to the code (e.g., add a space character) and save the updated code.
